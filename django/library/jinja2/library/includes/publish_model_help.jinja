        Our mission is to help computational modelers develop, document, and share their computational models in accordance with <a href='https://www.openmodelingfoundation.org/standards'>community standards</a> and <a href='{{ slugurl("guides-to-good-practice") }}'>good open science and software engineering practices</a>. Model authors can publish their model source code in the <a href="/codebases">Computational Model Library</a> with narrative documentation as well as metadata that supports open science and emerging norms that facilitate software citation, computational reproducibility / frictionless reuse, and interoperability. Model authors can also request <a href='/reviews/'>private peer review</a> of their computational models. Models that pass peer review receive a DOI once published.
        </p>
        <p>
        All users of models published in the library <b>must cite model authors</b> when they use and benefit from their code.

    We also maintain a <a href='https://catalog.comses.net'>curated database of over 7500 publications of
    agent-based and individual based models</a> with detailed metadata on availability of code and
    bibliometric information on the landscape of ABM/IBM publications that we welcome you to explore.
