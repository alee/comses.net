Dear {{ review.submitter.name }},

Congratulations! The peer review of your model [{{ release.title }}]({{ release_url }}) is complete and your release has been marked as peer reviewed. **Your release will remain private until you manually [publish it]({{release_publish_url}})**.

Once your model is published, a DOI will automatically be minted and assigned to this specific release of your model. Please be sure to include [a software citation of your model](https://libguides.mit.edu/software/citing) via this DOI in the references section of publications that depend on this specific model release.

Peer reviewed models are automatically featured on the CoMSES Net home page alongside an image that you can [upload here]({{ release_upload_image_url }}) - we **strongly recommend that you upload a screenshot or image for your model** to increase its visibility and reach.

If you have any questions or concerns about software citation, this peer review process, or other general feedback please feel free to [post on our forums](https://forum.comses.net/c/help/23) or [contact us]({{ build_absolute_uri(slugurl('contact')) }}). 


Thank you for submitting your computational models to CoMSES Net! We appreciate you taking the time to curate and entrust them with us and hope you will consider serving as a fellow peer reviewer for other researchers' computational models.

Best regards,
The CoMSES Net Editors
