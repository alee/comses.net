Dear {{ review.submitter.name }},

Congratulations! The peer review of your model [{{ release.title }}]({{ release_url }}) is now complete and your release has been marked as peer reviewed. **Your release will remain private until you [publish it yourself]({{release_publish_url}})**.

Once published, a DOI will be automatically minted and assigned to your model, if you encounter any issues with this process please feel free to [contact us]({{ build_absolute_uri(slugurl('contact')) }}). We also feature peer reviewed models on the CoMSES Net home page, if you wish to have yours displayed with an image you can [upload one here]({{ release_upload_image_url }}) if you have not done so already.

Thank you for submitting your computational model for review to CoMSES Net! Please consider serving as a reviewer of model code in future model peer reviews.

Best regards,
The CoMSES Net Editors
